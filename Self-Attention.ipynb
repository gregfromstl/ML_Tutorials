    "The purpose of attention is to consider each input's relation to all other inputs in a sequence. For the case of NLP, this would mean words. For example, in the sentence \"This meal was so good I would eat it every day.\" the ideal attention would specify high values between \"meal\", \"good\", and \"it\" (+ maybe \"eat\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of vision transformers, the sequential inputs are uniformly divided MxM patches of the input image. So input 1 might be the top left corner, input 2 the top middle, input 3 top right, input 4 middle left, and so on. This way, attention picks up on the relations between areas of an image. When put into transformers, this makes for efficient representation of the entire image, rather than relying on convolutions that focus on isolated regions."

    "\n",
    "2. The query and the key are used to learn attention through their dot product. For each position X in the query and position Y in the key, the attention score XY represents the importance of the input at position X in describing the input at position Y.\n",

    "3. The attention scores are then passed through a softmax layer so all scores are form 0 to 1.\n",
